# Journal Log
During the first session of the software testing project, we conducted tests on the HR DB application, which revealed several issues requiring immediate attention and resolution. Among the identified problems, we observed the possibility of adding duplicate employees, insufficient validation of data fields, the absence of a feature to delete team members and non-empty teams, as well as the inability to modify an employee's additional address after its creation. To manage these problems, we implemented a bug tracker to detect and track the evolution of bugs.

In the second and final session of the project, we initiated the process of writing tests. The goal was to generate code using the Playwright package and develop tests that would link with what was done during the first session. We created several tests, including those related to resetting the database, adding employees, and creating teams. Additionally, we developed a specific test linked to our bug tracker to verify the possibility of duplicating the same employee.
